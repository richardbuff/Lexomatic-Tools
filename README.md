# Not meant for public use
This custom WordPress plugin is made for a specific client for specific sites.  It's in a public repo because there is nothing sensitive in this plugin and to make authentication for WordPress updates easier.

It is not tested to work on any site other than the ones it was built for.

# Usage
After installing the plugin, go to Settings > Lexomatic Tools to see the options available to you.
