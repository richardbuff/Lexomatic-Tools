# Not meant for public use
This custom WordPress plugin is made for a specific client for specific sites.  It's in a public repo because there is nothing sensitive in this plugin and to make authentication for WordPress updates easier.

It is not tested to work on any site other than the ones it was built for.

# Installation
* Install the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin on your site first, if it is not already installed, by going [here](https://share.getcloudapp.com/9ZuArE9y) and clicking Clone or download, and choosing Download Zip. Then go to your WordPress Dashboard > Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin to install the zip file.
* Go to WP Dashboard > Settings > Github Updater > Install Plugin > and use this repo's URI: `https://github.com/richardbuff/lexomatic-tools` [Screenshot]{https://share.getcloudapp.com/9ZuArE9y}

# Updates
This plugin updates from this Github repo, not from the WordPress plugin repo, and relies on the site having the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin installed and activated in order to receive updates.

# Usage
After installing the plugin, go to Settings > Lexomatic Tools to see the options available to you.
